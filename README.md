# LastMileDelivery_Routing
This repository is part of an ongoing project in which a genetic algorithm is used to route E-Truck and E-Tricycles to customers across street blocks. The routing is performed in order to minimize distance, and in turn, minimize CO2 emissions. 

NOTE:
THIS REPOSITORY IS INCOMPLETE. MATLAB files that do not have my name in the comments were not written by me.
